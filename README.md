## üöÄ Project Overview

Welcome to my e-commerce platform! This project was created as the final assessment for my Frontend Development program at KYH. Its primary goal was to enhance my understanding of web accessibility and gain practical experience using assistive technologies like screen readers.

To achieve this, I conducted thorough research based on W3C guidelines and built an e-commerce site featuring essential functionalities, including product browsing with filtering and sorting options, as well as a user-friendly cart system. A key emphasis was placed on inclusive design principles, ensuring that the platform is accessible to all users.

I‚Äôm proud of the results, as this project has significantly deepened my knowledge of semantic HTML, WAI-ARIA guidelines, and how screen readers interact with web content.
