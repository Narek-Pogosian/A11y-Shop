## About the project

This project served as the final examination project for my Frontend Development program at KYH. The primary goal of this project was to learn more about Web Accessibility and to get familiar with tools such as screenreaders. I chose to do it by researching from various sources, mainly W3C and then built an e-commerce platform with common features such as product browsing with filtering and sort and a cart system with focus on inclusive design.

In summary, I am happy I chose this project as it significantly expanded my knowledge of semantic HTML and the WAI-ARIA guidelines and got a better understanding of how screenreaders are used.
