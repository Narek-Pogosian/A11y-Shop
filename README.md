## üöÄ About the Project

This project was developed as the final examination for my Frontend Development program at KYH. The primary objective was to deepen my understanding of Web Accessibility and to gain hands-on experience with tools such as screen readers.

To achieve this, I conducted extensive research, primarily referencing W3C guidelines, and built an e-commerce platform incorporating essential features like product browsing with filtering and sorting, as well as a cart system. A key focus was placed on inclusive design principles to ensure accessibility for all users.

Overall, I am very satisfied with the outcome of this project. It significantly enhanced my knowledge of semantic HTML, the WAI-ARIA guidelines, and gave me valuable insights into how screen readers interact with web content.
